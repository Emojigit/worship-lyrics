It Is Well with My Soul
Written by Horatio Spafford
!FOOTER-END

!EMPTY

When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;

Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Refrain
It is well, (it is well),

With my soul, (with my soul)
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,

That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,

Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
If Jordan above me shall roll,

No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;

Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.

And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;

The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
A song in the night, oh my soul!

The Lord's my shepherd,
I'll not want.

He makes me down to lie
in pastures green.
He leadeth methe quiet waters by.

!SECTION-START Shep-2
My soul he doth restore again,
and me to walk doth make

within the paths of righteousness,
e'en for his own name's sake.

!SECTION-START Shep-3
Yea, though I walk
in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill.

For thou art with me,
and thy rod and staff
me comfort still.

!SECTION-START Shep-4
My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes:

my head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.
!SECTION-END

!SECTION-START Shep-C
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me.

And in God's house for evermore
my dwelling place shall be.
