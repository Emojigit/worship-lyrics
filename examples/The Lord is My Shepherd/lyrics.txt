!FOOTER-START
The Lord's My Shepherd
by Francis Rous
!FOOTER-END

!SECTION-START Shep-1
The Lord's my shepherd,
I'll not want.

He makes me down to lie
in pastures green.
He leadeth methe quiet waters by.
!SECTION-END

!SECTION-START Shep-2
My soul he doth restore again,
and me to walk doth make

within the paths of righteousness,
e'en for his own name's sake.
!SECTION-END

!SECTION-START Shep-3
Yea, though I walk
in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill.

For thou art with me,
and thy rod and staff
me comfort still.
!SECTION-END

!SECTION-START Shep-4
My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes:

my head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.
!SECTION-END

!SECTION-START Shep-C
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me.

And in God's house for evermore
my dwelling place shall be.
